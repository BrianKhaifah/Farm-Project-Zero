                                <p id="p1">The Ayrshire cattle are of very good behavior and temperament. They are most dominant, least attacked by their group-mates and least susceptible to group change. They are known for their hardiness and their ability to convert
                                    grass into milk efficiently. The breedâ€™s strengths today are traits of easy calving and longevity. These cattle are very good for milk production as compared to their size. Milk production of a cow can reach 9,100 kg
                                    or greater per annum.</p>

                                <p id="p2">The Brown Swiss has one of the highest annual milk yields. The milk is high in both protein (around 3.5%) and butter fat (around 4%). This makes the breed an excellent choice for both milk and cheese producers. Indeed,
                                    Brown Swiss cattle produce the best fat to protein ratio of any dairy breed for most cheese production. Brown Swiss continue producing in the herd until they are 12 to 15 years old. They mature later than many other
                                    breeds and their inherent strength allows them to lead long, productive lives.</p>

                                <p id="p3">The Holstein Friesian breed is world-renowned for its unparalleled milk production value. Holsteins have an average lactation period of 305 days a year, with up to 18,000 liters of milk per lactation period. Their milk
                                    content is 3.82% fat and 3.21% protein. Top producing individuals, milked three times daily, have been known to produce over 30,000 kg of milk in a 365 day period. Holstein breeding are particularly fast growing, mature
                                    very early, and are easy to care for. When managed well, they have excellent fertility rates.</p>

                                        on less feed than other dairy breeds, eating about 80 percent of a Holstein's normal daily intake. Jersey cows have the longest productive life in the American dairy industry, generally about three years.</p>
